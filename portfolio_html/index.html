                        <h2 id="introduction">Hi, I'm George.</h2>
                        <p>Since graduating from college in 2014 with a degree in Hospitality, Tourism, and Event Management I have done a lot of different
                        things, most recently being a restaurant manager at the airports in Denver and San Francisco. I really enjoyed that position as I got to
                        develop many interpersonal communication skills while interacting with employees and guests every day. Before that, I spent three years abroad 
                        pursuing things centered around my love for travel and experiencing new cultures. Some highlights include: teaching English to kids in 
                        Vietnam while also running my own guesthouse there, doing a working-holiday in New Zealand where I worked on different farms while traveling,
                        doing various work exchange opportunites at different types of accomodations while traveling throughout Asia, and studying yoga and meditation in India.</p>
                        <p>
                        I chose to change careers into this field for a lot of different reasons that came together and made me take the leap. The first being
                        that I did not feel like I was being challenged enough in my last career and I felt a big urge to do something that would provide 
                        new challenges and more opportunities for personal development. Ive always had the curiosity to learn new skills and finally
                        aligned my interests in problem solving and abstract thinking with coding and software development. Another big reason is
                        because I dont't have much experience in technology and I feel the need to be further engaged in a world that is more and more reliant upon it.
                        I am new to studying web development but I have enjoyed learning so far and I am looking forward to the rest of this course! 
                        </p>      
                        <p>After this course I hope to find employment with a startup to continue learning and gain real world experience. Ultimately I would like to align my
                        my profession with my passion for travel and be able to work remotely. I am also interested in doing freelance work as a way to apply all of 
                        my skills and take on new projects. 
                        </p>
